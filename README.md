TouchscreenVisualizer
=====================

Winform Visualizer for the Nintendo DSL digitizer using an Arduino 


This is the hardware I am using:
Arduino UNO
Nintendo DSL digitizer: http://adafru.it/333



Project is a Visual Studio solution that can be run and edited using the free version of Visual Studio available here:
http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express
(I recommend downloading the Visual C# 2010, which is free and very good for using on winform projects like this)

If you have Visual Studio installed simply open the .sln file at the root of the project.
